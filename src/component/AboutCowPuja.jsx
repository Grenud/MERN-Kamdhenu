          At Sri Devraha Baba’s Ashram, Vrindavan, we have a long tradition of dedicated Cow seva as Sri Devraha Baba stated his blessings are with those devotees who serve and protect Cow Mata.
          <br />
          The unfortunate fate of many cows in India after their ability to produce milk has ceased is that they are either sent to slaughterhouses or abandoned by their owners to roam the streets as they are no longer seen as being productive. Here at Sri Devraha Baba’s Ashram in Vrindavan, we have started a movement in which we protect and care for cows regardless of their age or any illnesses they might have.
          <br />
          We are currently blessed with the opportunity of caring for over 500 cows and bulls and our numbers are increasing as we never refuse a cow or bull in need of shelter and care.
          <br />
          We treat Cow Mata with love and care and see great potential in utilizing all the magnificent things Cow Mata can produce and offer us apart from just giving milk, for example, we are exploring the possibility of making paper, tiles, bricks, medicine and natural gas from cow dung and urine.
