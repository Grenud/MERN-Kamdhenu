          Vedas simply refers to the term “knowledge” in Sanskrit and is a body of knowledge-literature written in Vedic Sanskrit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vedas are four forms of earliest scripts in Indian History, comprising of Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda, which lay down the ideas and principles of Vedic practices of classical Hindu Religion.

        <p>
          According to the <strong>Atharvavēda</strong>, “The cow is said to be the Universal sign to all Vedas.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There are <strong>33 Crore Deities</strong> within the cow, which is defined as Divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vedas also mention clearly that “Cow inside the house gives health and purity. She is a symbol of wealth and health."
        </p>
        <p>
          The vast description of the cow among Vedas establishes the fact that the cow is <strong>Holy</strong> and should be religiously worshipped for overall good.
