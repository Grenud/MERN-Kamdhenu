          You can become the guardian of one or more cows, her (their) friend,
          visit her (them) in the ashram of Sri Devraha Baba or receive news
          about her (them) remotely. You can also become just a happy donor,
          and the doors of the Sri Devraha Baba ashram will always be open to
          you. All friends of our Goshala cows always receive special blessings
          from Guruji Mahatma Sri Devdas Ji Maharaj.

              In the Sri Devraha Baba Ashram goshala, the mother cows receive full,
              balanced, and high-quality nutrition, care, and most importantly— 
              the love of caring people who came to the goshala from a calling in 
              the heart. In the name of human well-being and global well-being, cows 
              must be healthy and happy. Our employees—friends of Gomata— 
              thoroughly know how to meet all her needs, to make her stay in the 
              goshala comfortable and joyful. We carefully select environmentally 
              friendly feeds from trusted suppliers near Vrindavan for a varied 
              and balanced feeding of our cows, taking into account the seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              In winter, we give cows a variety of warming grains: oats,
              wheat, amaranth, wajour, chopped hay from rice shoots, corn, as
              well as root crops—potatoes, carrots, beets, and, finally, a little
              gur for raising body temperature and mood! In the warmer months,
              they eat a lot of fresh meadow grass, rich in vitamins and trace
              elements: clover, ryegrass, oatmeal, alfalfa, and many others. In the
              ashram goshala, 7 days a week, there is a veterinarian to perform
              routine preventive measures: an examination, spraying, and inclusion of
              vitamins or medicines in the feed. If necessary, we attract
              additional medical resources. We are very fond of our cows, the
              full-fledged inhabitants of the Ashram of Sri Devraha Baba, who are
              under His direct protection.
